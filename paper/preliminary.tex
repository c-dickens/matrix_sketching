Let $A \in \R^{n \times d}$ be the input data matrix and let $m$ be the
desired projection dimension.
The key quantity one is concerned with in understanding random projections of
the kind we are interested in is the notion of a \textit{subspace embedding}
which measures how well the directions of a matrix are captured by a small
space representation of a matrix.
This is formalised in the following definition:

\begin{mydef} \label{def: subspace-embedding}
  A matrix $S \in \R^{m \times n}$ is a \textit{$(1 \pm \eps)$-subspace embedding}
  for the column space of a matrix $A \in \R^{n \times d}$ if for all vectors
  $x \in \R^d, \|SAx\|_2^2 = (1 \pm \eps)\|Ax\|_2^2$.
\end{mydef}

\noindent We define the families of random matrices $S \in \R^{m \times n}$ that
are used to provide subspace embeddings.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Gaussian} sketch: $G_{ij} \sim N(0,1)$ and the matrix
  $S = G/\sqrt{m}$
  \item \textit{Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform (SRHT)}: $S = PHD$
  where $D$ is a diagonal matrix with $D_{ii} \in \{ \pm 1 \}$ each with
  probability $1/2$ independently.
  The matrix $H$ is the recursively defined Hadamard Transform and $P$ is
  a matrix
  which samples rows uniformly at random.
  \item \textit{CountSketch}: initialise $S = \mathbf{0}_{m,n}$ and for every
  column $i$ of $S$ choose a row $h(i)$ uniformly at random.
  Set $S_{h(i),j} = \pm 1$ with probability $1/2$.
  \item{\textit{TO INCLUDE: Sparse Johnson Lindenstrauss Transform (SJLT)}:}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Time Complexity of sketching methods:}
Each of the above described random projections defines a linear map from $\R^n
\to \R^m$ which naively would take $O(mnd)$.
Despite this, only the Gaussian sketch suffers from the matrix multiplication
time cost because the SRHT exploits the fast Hadamard transform which takes
$O(nd \log n)$ time as it is defined recursively.
Additionally, the CountSketch can be computed by streaming through the matrix
$A$: upon observing an entry $A_{ij}$, the value of a hash bucket defined
by the function $h$ is then updated with either $\pm A_{h(i),j}$ and hence
the time
to compute the CountSketch transform is roughly $O(\nnz{A})$.
In light of this the matrix $SA$ can be viewed both as a linear transform but
also a method of summarising the input data to a small space representation.

\begin{thm}[\cite{woodruff2014sketching}] \label{thm: subspace-embedding-dims}
  Let $A \in \R^{n \times d}$ have full column rank.
  Let $S \in \R^{m \times n}$ be sampled from one of the Gaussian, SRHT, or
  CountSketch distributions.
  Then to achieve the subspace embedding property with probability
  $1 - \delta$ we require:
  $m = O(\eps^{-2}(d + \log(1/\delta)))$ for the Gaussian sketch,
  $m = \Omega(\eps^{-2}(\log d) (\sqrt{d} + \sqrt{n})^2)$ for the SRHT,
  $m = O(d^2/(\delta \eps^2))$ for the CountSketch.
\end{thm}

Theorem \ref{thm: subspace-embedding-dims} highlights an important distinction
to be made between the sketching methods.
Firstly, the projection dimension, $m$, of both the Gaussian and SRHT is dependent
(at worst) $d \text{poly} \log d$ whereas the CountSketch, despite being faster to
apply, depends on $d^2$.
As such, the CountSketch is suboptimal with respect to the projection dimension
as $d^2$ projections are required: \color{red} the reason being that it is the number of buckets required to
ensure that $d$ directions are hashed perfectly into $m$ buckets.
\color{black} In addition, the failure probability of the CountSketch depends \textit{linearly}
upon $\delta$ whereas both the Gaussian and SRHT depend on $\log 1 / \delta$.
This is a significant difference and is sufficient evidence for one to question
the practical efficacy of the CountSketch given that it is theoretically suboptimal
with respect to two important parameters.
Despite the theoretical deficiency of the CountSketch, we give compelling evidence
that it can be used in practise as an extremely fast alternative to both of the
previously mentioned projection methods.

\subsection{Setup}
Throughout we consider examples of overconstrained regression in the form of
a data matrix $A \in \R^{n \times d}$ and target vector $b \in \R^{n}$ with
$n \gg d$.
Also given is a set of convex constraints $\mathcal{C}$ and the task is to
find the \textit{optimal estimator}:

\begin{equation}
  x_{OPT} = \argmin_{x \in \mathcal{C}} \frac{1}{2} \|Ax-b\|_2^2.
\end{equation}

We consider two popular models of sketching as well as different types
of random projections.
The two methods are know as \textit{sketch-and-solve} and \textit{iterative
Hessian sketching} (IHS) which we now outline.
For a random projection $S$, the sketch-and-solve approach outputs estimates
of the form:

\begin{equation} \label{eq: sketch-and-solve}
  \hat{x}_S = \argmin_{x \in \mathcal{C}} \frac{1}{2} \|S(Ax-b)\|_2^2.
\end{equation}
\noindent In contrast, the IHS method instead sketches in the following manner:

\begin{equation} \label{eq: ihs}
  x^{t+1} = \argmin_{x \in \mathcal{C}}  \frac{1}{2} \|S^{t+1} A
  (x - x^t) \|^2 - \langle A^T (y - Ax^t), x - x^t \rangle.
\end{equation}

The reason for the differing approaches is due to the following notions of
approximation that we introduce as \textit{cost} and \textit{solution}
approximation.
Let $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\|Ax-b\|_2^2$ for input parameters $(A,b)$ and let
$x_{OPT}$ denote the optimal solution.
We also use the following notation: $\|x\|_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\|Ax\|_2$.

\begin{mydef} \label{def: cost-approx}
  An algorithm which outputs $\hat{x}$ is a $(1 + \eps)$ \textit{cost
   approximation} if $f(\hat{x}) \le (1+\eps) f(x_{OPT})$.
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef} \label{def: sol-approx}
  An algorithm which returns $\hat{x}$ such that $\|x_{OPT} - \hat{x}\|_A
  \le \eps \|x_{OPT}\|_2$ is referred to as a $\eps$-\textit{solution
  approximation} algorithm.
\end{mydef}

Inspecting Equations (\ref{eq: sketch-and-solve}) and (\ref{eq: ihs}) one
sees that that a key quantity we need to understand is that of
a \textit{subspace embedding} introduced in Definition \ref{def: subspace-embedding}.
Each of the sketches defined in Section \ref{sec: intro} achieves the subspace
embedding criterion which is summarised in Theorem
\ref{thm: subspace-embedding-dims}.
One can immediately see that the subspace embedding obtains a ($1+\eps$)-cost
approximation to the problem

\noindent \textbf{Time Complexity of sketching models.}
The time taken for each of the models is simply the sketch time $T_{\text{sketch}}$
and the time to solve a smaller problem in the `sketch space', $T_{\text{solve}}$.
When the data is compressed into a summary of rougly $d \times d$ then $T_{\text{solve}}$
is $O(d^3)$; note that this can potentially be $O(d^4)$ if we require the full
$d^2$ projections from the CountSketch but this does not seem to occur in
practise as for many datasets $n$ is sufficiently large compared to $d$ that
CountSketch performs comparably with the other sketching methods.
Note that for the IHS model, we must repeat this $O(\log 1/\eps)$ times for
convergence whereas sketch-and-solve is a `one-shot' algorithm.

\end{itemize}

\color{red}
It has also been argued in \cite{wang2017sketching} that IHS is acting as
a preconditioned approach to the Newton method.
Indeed, for $f(x) = \frac{1}{2} \|Ax-b\|_2^2$ we see that $\nabla f(x) =
-A^T(b-Ax)$.
In the iterates, the task is to find $u' = \argmin_{x \in \mathcal{C}}
\frac{1}{2}\|SAu\|_2^2 - u^TA^T(b-Ax_t)$.
By solving the unconstrained problem one would obtain $u' = (A^TS^TSA)^{-1}
A^T(b-Ax_t)$ and thus, $u' = - \tilde{H}^{-1} \nabla f(x_t)$.
Then taking $x^{t+1} = \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{C}} (x^t + u')$ we obtain
$x^{t+1} = \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{C}} (x^t - \tilde{H}^{-1}\nabla f(x_t))$
which is a projected Newton step with a sketched approximation to
the Hessian.

\subsection{Motivating the IHS: Sketch-and-Solve Suboptimality} \label{sec: why-ihs}

For a variety of the results we asume the standard Gaussian design
stating that $y = A x^* + \omega$ (in contrast results from the sketch-and-solve
model hold with no assumptions on the noise vector $\omega$).
Here, the data $A$ is fixed and there exists an unknown ground truth
vector $x^*$ belonging to some compact $\mathcal{C}_0 \subseteqq \mathcal{C}$.
In addition, the error vector $\omega$ has entries are drawn
by $\omega_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$.
In order to compare the output of an algorithm, $\hat{x}$, to that of the
\color{red} `exact' (TERMINOLOGY optimal / best ??!!) \color{black} estimator, $x_{OPT}$ Pilanci and Wainwright
showed that the expected solution error could be bounded above as a function
of the input size and from below as
In addition, it was shown that any estimator $x'$ which observes the pair
$(SA, Sb)$ is provably suboptimal in the sense outlined in Theorem
\ref{thm: clsq-lower-bound}.
The key condition is that a sketching matrix has the following
property (in spectral norm):

\begin{equation} \label{eq: sketch-spectral-property}
  \| \E \left[ S^T (S S^T)^{-1} S \right] \|_2 \le \eta \frac{m}{n}
\end{equation}

\begin{thm}[\cite{pilanci2016iterative}] \label{thm: clsq-lower-bound}
  Let $S \in \R^{m \times n}$ be a sketching matrix which satisfies
  Equation (\ref{eq: sketch-spectral-property}), then any estimator
  based on observing $(SA, Sb)$ has solution error lower bounded as:

  \begin{equation}
    \sup_{x^* \in \mathcal{C}_0} \E_{S,\omega} [\|x^* - x'\|_A^2 ]
     = \Omega \left(
    \frac{\sigma^2}{\eta \min(m,n)} \right).
  \end{equation}
\end{thm}

\begin{rem}
  We note that the constants for Theorem \ref{thm: clsq-lower-bound} are
  explicitly known and are simply the factor $\log(0.5 M_{0.5})/128\eta$
  which we omit for brevity.
  Note that $M_{0.5}$ is the $0.5$-packing number of $\mathcal{C}_0$ in
  the semi-norm $\| \cdot \|_A$.
\end{rem}
Although we omit the details (which can be found in \cite{pilanci2016iterative})
we note that the CountSketch satisfies the spectral condition (\ref{eq: sketch-spectral-property})
and as such, suffers from the same suboptimality as the previously used
sketching methods in the sketch-and-solve model.
This is proved in Theorem \ref{thm: spectral-theorem} and hence motivates the
novel use of CountSketch within the IHS framework rather than the straightforward
sketch-and-solve model.

\begin{prop}[\cite{pilanci2016iterative}] \label{prop: ihs-error-bound}
  For any set $\mathcal{C}$ containing $x^*$, the constrained least-squares
  estimate $x_{OPT}$ has prediction error upper bounded as:

  \begin{equation}
    \E \|x_{OPT} - x^* \|_A^2 \le c \left(\eps_n(\mathcal{\bar{K}}) +
    \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right).
  \end{equation}
  For the unconstrained case we have the prediction error is $O(\sigma^2 d/n)$.
\end{prop}

The proofs detailing the structural results of why we can use the CountSketch
within the IHS are given in Appendix \ref{sec: countsketch-proofs} however we
outline the key details here.
First we need that the sketches are zero mean and have identity covariance
$\E(S^TS) = I_{n}$ which is shown in Lemma \ref{lem:covariance_matrix}.
Two further properties are required for the error bounds of the IHS.

\begin{mydef}
  The \textit{tangent cone} is the following set:
  \begin{equation}
    K = \{ v \in \R^d : v = tA(x-x_{OPT}), ~ t \ge 0, x \in \mathcal{C}\}
  \end{equation}
\end{mydef}
\noindent We note that the residual error vector for an approximation $\hat{x}$
belongs to this set as $u=A(\hat{x} - x_{OPT})$.
Let $X = K \cap \mathcal{S}^{n-1}$ where $\mathcal{S}^{n-1}$ is the set of $n$-
dimensional vectors which have unit Euclidean norm.
The quanitites we need to understand are:

\begin{align}
  Z_1 &= \inf_{u \in X} \|Su\|_2^2 \\
  Z_2 &= \sup_{u \in X} | u^T S^T S v - u^T v |.
\end{align}
\noindent Here, $v$ denotes a fixed unit-norm $n$-dimensional vector and assume
that $S$ is a subspace embedding for the column space of $A$.
For the IHS conditions to hold it is required that $Z_1 \ge 1-\eps$ and
$Z_2 \le \eps/2$ for $\eps \in (0,1/2)$.
Since $ u \in K \subseteq \text{col}(A)$ and then by the subspace embedding
property we have that $\|Su\|_2^2 = (1 \pm \eps)\|u\|_2^2 = (1 \pm \eps)$ and
hence $Z_1  \ge 1-\eps$ as required.
The second property follows from approximate matrix product with sketching
matrices:
indeed, for a matrix $X$ with only one nonzero $X_{ij}$ then $\|X\|_F = (X_{ij}^2)^{1/2}$
which is exactly $|X_ij|$.
Pad $u$ and $v$ with zeros until they are both $d \times k$ dimensional, to get
$\mat{u}$ and $\mat{v}$ respectively so that we can now apply the matrix product
(Theorem 13 of \cite{woodruff2014sketching} but originally \cite{kane2014sparser}).
This gives $\|\mat{u}^T S^TS \mat{v} - \mat{u}^T\mat{v}\|_F \le 3 \eps \|\mat{u}\|_F \|\mat{v}\|_F$
for $\eps \in (0,1/2)$.
Now, by rescaling $\eps$, recalling that the definitions of $\mat{u},\mat{v},u,v$
mean $\|\mat{u}\|_F = 1, \|\mat{v}\|_F=1$ and then error difference has exactly
one element so therefore reduces to the absolute value of that element, which is
exactly $| u^T S^T S v - u^T v |$ and hence $Z_2 \le \eps$.
Note that although the condition on $Z_2$ looks like a Johnson Lindenstrauss
Transform property, we cannot immediately invoke that for the CountSketch in the
general case due to a lower bound on the column sparsity needed for  a JLT
(discussion of this can be found in \cite{woodruff2014sketching} between Theorems
7 and 8).
Coupled with the fact that the rows of a CountSketch matrix $S$ are sub-Gaussian,
we are now free to use the CountSketch within the IHS framework.
